# Contact Potion

A Flask contact form for your static website.

Many sites could be served as static files except for a single dynamic element;
the site owner wants a way to receive emails from the website without exposing
email addresses to spambots.

Contact-Potion solves this issue, and assumes that you'll be running more than
one such static site, each with its own look and feel, response categories, and
recipients. Furthermore, it does this without exposing the recipient email
address to the web.
